    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">1. What is an operating system?</div>
        <div class="answer">An operating system (OS) is software that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">2. What are the types of operating systems?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batch OS:</strong> Executes jobs in batches with no interaction with users.</li>
                <li><strong>Multitasking OS:</strong> Supports multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., Windows, Linux).</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time OS:</strong> Provides immediate processing for real-time applications (e.g., embedded systems).</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed OS:</strong> Manages multiple independent computers as if they were a single system (e.g., Google's distributed systems).</li>
                <li><strong>Network OS:</strong> Manages network resources (e.g., Novell NetWare).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">3. What is the difference between a process and a thread?</div>
        <div class="answer">A process is an independent program in execution, with its own memory space. A thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process, sharing the same memory but having its own execution path.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">4. What is process scheduling?</div>
        <div class="answer">Process scheduling is the method by which the OS allocates CPU time to various processes. It involves determining which process runs at any given time.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">5. What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?</div>
        <div class="answer">Preemptive scheduling allows a process to be interrupted and replaced by another, while non-preemptive scheduling ensures that a process runs to completion before another process starts.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">6. What are the main process scheduling algorithms?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):</strong> Processes are executed in the order they arrive.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Job Next (SJN):</strong> The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.</li>
                <li><strong>Round Robin (RR):</strong> Processes are executed in fixed time slices.</li>
                <li><strong>Priority Scheduling:</strong> Processes are executed based on priority.</li>
                <li><strong>Multilevel Queue:</strong> Processes are grouped into queues based on priority or type.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">

    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">13. What is virtual memory?</div>
        <div class="answer">Virtual memory allows the execution of processes that may not be completely loaded into physical memory. It uses disk space as an extension of RAM, swapping data between them.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">14. What is thrashing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Thrashing occurs when the OS spends more time swapping data between physical memory and disk than executing processes, resulting in severe performance degradation.</div>
    </div>

    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">24. What is an interrupt?</div>
        <div class="answer">An interrupt is a signal to the processor, indicating an event that requires immediate attention, causing the OS to temporarily stop executing the current process and handle the interrupt.</div>

        <div class="question">37. What is cooperative multitasking?</div>
        <div class="answer">Cooperative multitasking is a type of multitasking where processes voluntarily yield control of the CPU. If a process fails to do so, it can monopolize the CPU, potentially causing system instability.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">38. What is a page fault?</div>
