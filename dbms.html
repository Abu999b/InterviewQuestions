            <p class="answer">Hierarchical DBMS: Data is organized in a tree-like structure (e.g., IBM's Information Management System).<br><br>
            Network DBMS: Data is organized in a graph structure where records are nodes, and relationships are edges (e.g., Integrated Data Store).<br><br>
            Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows and columns, and relationships are established through keys (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).<br><br>
            Object-oriented DBMS: Data is stored as objects, similar to object-oriented programming (e.g., ObjectDB).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-container">
            <div class="question"><span class="question-number">3</span>What is a table in a relational database?</div>
            <p class="answer">A table is a collection of rows (records) and columns (attributes) in a relational database. Each table represents a different entity or object in the system.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-container">
